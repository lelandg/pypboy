Remember that one Python Pip-Boy 3000 project? Neither do we! (But GitHub and BitBucket do!)<br>
This fork will be updated with any GPIO changes, etc. So far I have only minor changes (to the config). However, if I hit bugs, I plan to fix them! üëç

Uses OSM for map data and has been partially tailored to respond to physical switches over Raspberry Pi's GPIO<br>
Works with Screen TFT 2.8" Capacitive of Adafruit.
